# Vector2

---
### In new Version you have 3 way to create Vector2

### `Vector2(x, y)`

*Returns:* (`Vector2`)

This is a constructor, and to create it, you precede the word `Vector2` with `x` and `y` in parentheses.

### `Vector2(x)`

*Returns:* (`Vector2`)

The same as the code above, only in this case the value of `y` will be equal to `X`

### `Vector2()`

*Returns:* (`Vector2`)

In this case, both coordinates will be equal to `0`

## Variables

Vector2 has two variables x and y. In order to get you need to refer to the vector as a structure
They are not static and in order to access them you need to make an instance of Vector2

### `Vector2.x`

*Returns:* (`real`)

### `Vector2.y`

*Returns:* (`real`)
